* Implement forward rendering

* Implement headless

* Input management

* Program argument parser class?

* Move testing from a configuration to a program argument

* Implement light structures into rendering pipeline (right now they're hardcoded in the Deferred pipeline)

* Clean up serializing of resources (having overloads in the header is _ugly_)

* Uniform parameter overloading in mesh renderers
